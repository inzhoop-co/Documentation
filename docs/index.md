# A flexible document

Simple text to create paragraphs.
Outlines itself.
Easy to share, transform, re-use, re-style.

## Like a cover page.
`index.md` is a markdown file kind of like a cover page for the
document.

### Subdirectories are chapters/sections
Make a subdirectory and put another `index.md` or name your files.
